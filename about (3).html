                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <h2> We participated in my first ever Hackathon organised by Hence Technologies, Upskiller and Mate in collaboration with the GITAM University.</h2>
                <h2>It was a 28-hour Hackaton with students of varying skill sets competing from all over the campus.My goodness, was We were nervous in the beginning, 40 registered teams were working on creating a solution that would “increase social connection among Youth”.</h2>
                <h2>It also gave confidence by Meeting mentors and speaking to multiple people about the solution helped the team even come to a better understanding of our product and the actual value proposition it had to the users.</h2>
